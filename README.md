**Scraper exercise modified for our fantasy football blog project**
I then took the priciples of the cheerio query and decided to try to scrape the CBS sports fantasy football page for news articles. I wanted the title, author, image, link, and store these in an array.

Next steps will be do run a loop on the array to display the first 4 articles in the array in React. A simple example of the loop will run here, and be added to the FFBlog project at a later date. This repo is for testing and learning.
